# Description

## Challenges

There was no SDK provided for angular, so i had to choose between ```IFrame API``` and the ```lib-jitsi-meet``` low level API. I chose the ```IFrame API``` because it's more compact (faster and easier) to use.



## Requirements
- Nodejs version 16 or older

## How to run

1. You need to install the necessary modules using ```npm install command``` at the root of the project.

2. You can run the project entering ```ng serve``` command at the root of the project.
